I'm Alive
CÃ©line Dion
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh, I'm alive
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive
When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

# Emmanuel
When you call on me
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
I am alive
# Emmanuel

# Emmanuel
When you reach for me
When you reach for me
