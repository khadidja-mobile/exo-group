I'm Alive
Céline Dion
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh, I'm alive
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive
When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

La suite est à vous !


When you reach for me
When you reach for me
Raising spirits high
God knows that
That I'll be the one
Standing by through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait…
